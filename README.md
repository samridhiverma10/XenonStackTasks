Introducing "Get Guidance," a MERN-based web application aimed at bridging the communication gap between seniors and juniors in educational institutions. It serves as a platform for students to interact, ask questions, and seek guidance from their peers. Users can easily post queries, which not only benefit them but also others with similar concerns. Additionally, students can contribute articles to share their knowledge and insights. To streamline the registration process and save users' time, the website integrates Google authentication for sign-in and logout. The user-friendly interface facilitates easy question posting, with the option to upload accompanying images via a provided picture link. "Get Guidance" is invaluable for students seeking information about college opportunities, effectively fostering communication and knowledge-sharing between seniors and juniors.
