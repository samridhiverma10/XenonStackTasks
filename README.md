Introducing "Get Guidance," a MERN-based web application for educational institutions. 
It serves as a platform for students to interact, ask questions, and seek guidance from their peers. 
Users can easily post queries, which not only benefit them but also others with similar concerns. 
Additionally, students can contribute articles to share their knowledge and insights. 
To streamline the registration process and save users' time, the website integrates Google authentication for sign-in and logout.
